# Compound Interest Calculator üí∞

A simple Python program to calculate **Compound Interest (CI)** and the **Total Amount (A)** after a given time period.

## Formula
<div align="center">

$$
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t
$$

</div>

- **P** = Principal Amount (Initial Investment)  
- **r** = Annual Rate of Interest (in %)  
- **t** = Time (in years)  
- **A** = Total Amount after time *t*  
- **I = A - P** (Compound Interest)  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0PKunal/Compound-Interest-Calculator-in-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd /Compound-Interest-Calculator-in-Python
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
    python compound_interest.py
   ```
## Example

```
Enter the principal amount(P): 1234
Enter the interest rate(r in %): 12.34
Enter the time(t in years): 12

Compound Interest(I) = 3751.72
Total AMount (A) after (t) years = 4985.72
```
